# Notes about Java8

## Lambdas in Java
* Motivation: Need better ways to support multicore. Makes thread handling more high level for iterations.
* In Java, lambda expressions is SAM-type, which is an interface with only one abstract method.
* java.util.function - functional interfaces that are intended to be used by the new API.
